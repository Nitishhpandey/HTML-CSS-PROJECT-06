# 6th HTML-CSS PROJECT

This project explores the use of icone and the Flex property in HTML/CSS.

## Description

In this project, I have learnt to add icons and using the Flex property, which is a powerful tool in CSS. With the Flex property, I was able to easily manipulate the arrangement of elements within a container, adjusting their size, alignment, and order as needed.
